# Bonato3D, my own graphics (OpenGL & GLFW), game and physics engine (work in progress)

## Current progress: a colored cube, a floor, and you can move and jump
You can move around and change your view direction to see this cube from different angles, while moving and jumping. That's it for now.

## Methodology / algorithms
The algorithms for frustum culling (incl. the is_line_visible function), triangle clipping, camera translation and rotation I have created myself, 
so you may not find similar code anywhere else. If you have any questions, feel free to email me.
